# HolevoCentrality
Python 3 implementation of the Holevo centrality introduced and analysed in [1,2,3]. Please cite our work if you use this code.

The Python file contains the implementations of:

(a) Von Neumann entropy of a graph, both Laplacian- and normalised Laplacian-based, and both exact and approximate

(b) Holevo edge centrality

(c) Holevo node centrality

Dependencies:

- NetworkX (https://networkx.org/)

- Numpy (https://numpy.org/)
